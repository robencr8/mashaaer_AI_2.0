# Content Security Policy (CSP) Fix for Mashaaer Enhanced Project

## Problem Description

The application was triggering a Content Security Policy (CSP) error in the browser, which was preventing the use of dangerous functions like `eval()` or `new Function()`. These functions are considered security vulnerabilities that could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

The error message indicated that the browser's Content Security Policy was blocking the use of these functions because they are considered unsafe.

## Cause

The issue was caused by the webpack configuration using "eval" in the devtool setting. When webpack uses "eval" for source maps, it generates code that uses the `eval()` function, which is blocked by modern browsers' Content Security Policy.

Webpack 5's default devtool setting in development mode is often "eval" or "eval-source-map", which provides fast rebuilds but uses the unsafe `eval()` function.

## Solution Implemented

The solution was to update the `config-overrides.js` file to explicitly set the devtool option to "source-map" instead of "eval":

```javascript
// Change devtool from 'eval' to 'source-map' to avoid CSP issues
config.devtool = 'source-map';
```

This change ensures that webpack generates source maps without using the `eval()` function, which makes the application compatible with strict Content Security Policies in modern browsers.

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Improved Security**: Eliminates the use of `eval()`, which is a potential security vulnerability
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Works with browsers that have strict Content Security Policies
3. **Better Debugging**: "source-map" provides high-quality source maps for debugging

## Testing

A test script (`test-csp-fix.bat`) was created to verify the fix:
1. Sets the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable to --openssl-legacy-provider
2. Starts the frontend using npm start with the updated webpack configuration

## Alternative Options

For development environments where performance is a priority, you could also use "cheap-module-source-map" instead of "source-map". This provides a good balance between build speed and debugging quality while still avoiding the use of `eval()`.

## Important Note

Never use the unsafe alternative of adding `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval';">` to your HTML, as this would disable an important security protection in your application.
