# Fixing Blank Page Issue in Mashaaer Enhanced

## Problem

If you see a blank page when accessing the application, it might be because the React frontend build files are not properly referenced in the launch.html template. The following error messages in the logs indicate this issue:

```
GET /static/js/main.d9eb5e2a.js HTTP/1.1" 404 -
GET /static/css/main.1d114b90.css HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

This happens because:

1. The React build process generates files with hashes in their names (e.g., main.1d114b90.css and main.522053f4.js)
2. These files are correctly copied to the backend/static directory
3. However, the launch.html template is referencing files without the hashes (e.g., main.css and main.js)

## Solution

We've provided two scripts to fix this issue:

1. `fix-frontend-paths.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows PowerShell users
2. `fix-frontend-paths.bat` - Batch file for Windows Command Prompt users

These scripts will:

1. Find the CSS and JS files with hashes in the build directory or extract the filenames from the index.html file
2. Update the launch.html template to reference the correct files with hashes

### Using PowerShell (Recommended)

1. Open PowerShell
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the script:
   ```
   .\fix-frontend-paths.ps1
   ```

### Using Command Prompt

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the script:
   ```
   fix-frontend-paths.bat
   ```

## Manual Fix

If you prefer to fix the issue manually:

1. Open the backend/static/index.html file and find the CSS and JS filenames with hashes:
   ```html
   <link href="/static/css/main.1d114b90.css" rel="stylesheet">
   <script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.522053f4.js"></script>
   ```

2. Open the backend/templates/launch.html file and update the references:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Mashaaer Enhanced</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/static/css/main.1d114b90.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <div id="root"></div>
       <script src="/static/cosmic-theme.js"></script>
       <script src="/static/static/js/main.522053f4.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

## Preventing This Issue in the Future

To prevent this issue in the future, you can modify the build-and-copy.bat and build-and-copy.ps1 scripts to:

1. Extract the CSS and JS filenames with hashes from the build/index.html file
2. Use these filenames when creating the launch.html template

Alternatively, you can use the fix-frontend-paths.ps1 or fix-frontend-paths.bat script after running the build-and-copy script.

## Running the Application

After fixing the issue, you can run the application:

```
cd backend
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/launch
```

You should now see the React frontend properly rendered by the Flask backend.
