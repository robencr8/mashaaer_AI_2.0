## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
1. Implement a modular, services-based architecture
2. Use dependency injection for better testability
3. Separate business logic from UI components
4. Utilize React Context API for accessing services

### Performance
1. Optimize for resource efficiency, especially for Arabic language processing
2. Implement lazy loading of heavy components
3. Manage memory usage with automatic consolidation
4. Meet response time targets:
   - Text analysis: < 100ms for basic emotion detection
   - Voice processing: < 300ms for real-time interaction
   - Complex responses: < 1.5s for full context-aware responses

### Security
1. Process sensitive data locally when possible
2. Encrypt all communications with external services using TLS/SSL
3. Encrypt stored data at rest using AES-256
4. Implement JWT-based authentication for API access
5. Enforce role-based access control for multi-user deployments
6. Validate and sanitize all user inputs

### Scalability
1. Design components to be stateless for easy replication
2. Support horizontal scaling through microservices architecture
3. Enable vertical scaling through configurable resource allocation
4. Support multi-region deployment for global accessibility

### Deployment
1. Package the entire application (React + Flask + Models) into a single executable
2. Support standard deployment to web hosting platforms
3. Provide comprehensive deployment documentation

## System Constraints
