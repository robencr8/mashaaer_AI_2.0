## Using the New Features

### Building the Installer

To build the custom branded installer:

1. Navigate to the `packaging/electron` directory
2. Run the download-assets script to get placeholder images:
   ```powershell
   .\download-assets.ps1
   ```
3. Run the packaging script:
   ```powershell
   .\package-electron.ps1
   ```
4. The installer will be created in the `packaging/electron/dist` directory

### Customizing the Installer

To customize the installer branding:

1. Replace the placeholder images in the `packaging/electron` directory:
   - `icon.ico` - Application icon
   - `splash.png` - Splash screen shown during installation
   - `installer-background.png` - Sidebar image for the installer

2. Edit the `installer.nsh` file to customize the installer behavior and text

3. Edit the `license.html` file to update the license agreement

### License Activation System

The license activation system works as follows:

1. When the application starts, it checks for a valid license
2. If no valid license is found, the activation window is displayed
3. The user enters their license key, name, and email
4. The license is validated and stored securely
5. The application starts after successful activation

For testing purposes, any license key in the format `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` will be accepted.

To modify the license validation logic:

1. Edit the `license-manager.js` file in the `packaging/electron` directory
2. Update the `activateLicense` method to implement your actual license validation logic
3. In a production environment, this would typically validate the license key with a server

### Preparing for Distribution

To prepare the application for distribution:

1. Navigate to the `packaging` directory
2. Run the distribution preparation script:
   ```powershell
   .\prepare-distribution.ps1 -Version "1.0.0"
   ```
3. This will create:
   - Installer and portable versions
   - Files prepared for GitHub Releases
   - Files prepared for Google Drive
   - Distribution summary

You can customize the distribution process by using the script parameters:

```powershell
.\prepare-distribution.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -CreateInstaller $true -CreatePortable $true -PrepareForGitHub $true -PrepareForGoogleDrive $true
```

### Public Launch Preparation

A comprehensive public launch checklist has been created to guide you through the process of preparing for a successful launch. The checklist covers:

- Pre-launch testing
- Documentation requirements
- Distribution preparation
- Marketing and communication
- Support infrastructure
- Post-launch planning

To use the checklist:

1. Open `docs/PUBLIC_LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Assign owners to each section
3. Set deadlines for completion
4. Track progress regularly
5. Use it as a guide during launch planning meetings

## Implementation Details

### Installer Customization

The installer is built using Electron Builder with NSIS. The customization is implemented in:

- `packaging/electron/package.json` - Configuration for Electron Builder
- `packaging/electron/installer.nsh` - NSIS script for installer customization
- `packaging/electron/license.html` - License agreement displayed during installation

### License Activation

The license activation system is implemented in:

- `packaging/electron/license-manager.js` - Core license management functionality
- `packaging/electron/activation.html` - User interface for license activation
- `packaging/electron/main.js` - Integration with the main application
- `packaging/electron/preload.js` - IPC communication for license activation

### Distribution Preparation

The distribution preparation is implemented in:

- `packaging/prepare-distribution.ps1` - Script for preparing distribution files
- `packaging/electron/package-electron.ps1` - Script for building the Electron app

## Next Steps

After implementing these changes, you should:

1. Replace the placeholder images with your actual branded images
2. Implement proper license key validation with a server
3. Set up your GitHub repository for releases
4. Configure your Google Drive for file hosting
5. Follow the public launch checklist to prepare for release
