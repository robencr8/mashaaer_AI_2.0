## Logging System

A centralized logging system has been implemented to provide consistent logging across the application.

### Implementation Details

- **Logger Utility**: A base logger utility (`src/utils/logger.js`) that provides methods for logging at different levels (debug, info, warn, error).
- **Logging Service**: A service (`src/services/logging/logging-service.js`) that integrates with the configuration system to determine log levels and provides a consistent API for logging.
- **Configuration Integration**: The logging level can be configured via the application configuration (`system.logLevel` and `system.debugMode`).
- **Component-Specific Logging**: The logging service provides a method to create component-specific loggers that prefix log messages with the component name.

### Usage

```javascript
// Using the logging service directly
const loggingService = useLoggingService();
loggingService.debug('Debug message');
loggingService.info('Info message');
loggingService.warn('Warning message');
loggingService.error('Error message', errorObject);

// Creating a component-specific logger
const logger = loggingService.createComponentLogger('MyComponent');
logger.info('Component-specific message');
```

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: Provides a consistent logging format across the application.
- **Configurability**: Logging levels can be configured via the application configuration.
- **Extensibility**: The logging system can be extended to send logs to a server or other destination.
- **Debugging**: Makes debugging easier by providing more context in log messages.

## Error Handling Strategy

A consistent error handling strategy has been implemented to provide better error reporting and handling across the application.

### Implementation Details

- **Error Handler Utility**: A base error handler utility (`src/utils/error-handler.js`) that provides methods for creating and handling errors.
- **Error Service**: A service (`src/services/error/error-service.js`) that integrates with the logging service to log errors and provides a consistent API for error handling.
- **Error Types**: Common error types (validation, network, authentication, etc.) are defined to categorize errors.
- **Component-Specific Error Handling**: The error service provides a method to create component-specific error handlers.

### Usage

```javascript
// Using the error service directly
const errorService = useErrorService();
try {
  // Some code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  errorService.handleError(error, 'MyComponent');
}

// Creating a specific error
const validationError = errorService.createValidationError('Invalid input', { field: 'username' });
throw validationError;

// Creating a component-specific error handler
const errorHandler = errorService.createComponentErrorHandler('MyComponent');
try {
  // Some code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  errorHandler.handleError(error);
}
```

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: Provides a consistent error handling strategy across the application.
- **Categorization**: Errors are categorized by type for better handling and reporting.
- **Integration with Logging**: Errors are automatically logged with context information.
- **Debugging**: Makes debugging easier by providing more context in error messages.

## State Management

A state management service has been implemented to provide guidance on global state management in the application.

### Implementation Details

- **State Management Service**: A service (`src/services/state/state-management-service.js`) that provides recommendations for state management and a basic implementation.
- **Zustand Recommendation**: The service recommends using Zustand for state management and provides examples of how to implement it.
- **Migration Guide**: A guide for migrating from React Context to Zustand is included.

### Recommendations

The service recommends using Zustand for state management for the following reasons:
- Lightweight and simple API
- No boilerplate code required
- Works with React hooks
- Can be used with or without React
- Supports middleware for advanced use cases
- Better performance than Redux for most use cases

### Migration

To migrate from React Context to Zustand:
1. Install Zustand: `npm install zustand`
2. Convert context providers to Zustand stores
3. Update component usage to use the Zustand hooks
4. Remove context providers from the application

See the migration guide in the state management service for detailed examples.

## Next Steps

### Testing

- Write unit tests for the new services and utilities
- Test the integration of the new services with the existing application
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Documentation

- Update the existing documentation to reflect the new architecture
- Add examples of how to use the new services in different scenarios
- Document best practices for logging, error handling, and state management

### Performance Optimization

- Monitor the performance impact of the new services
- Optimize the initialization of services
- Consider lazy loading or code splitting for better performance
