# Verified Language Files Report

## Overview
This report documents files that have been verified for linguistic correctness. These files contain content in various languages that may be flagged by automated spell-checkers but are actually valid in their respective languages.

## Verified Files

### 🇵🇭 fil.json
**Location:** `src/translations/locales/fil.json`
**Language:** Filipino
**Status:** ✅ Valid Filipino
**Notes:** All words flagged (e.g., Maligayang, pagdating, iyong, mensahe, emosyon, etc.) are standard Filipino language. This is not an error.
**Validation:** A companion file `fil.json.validated` has been created to mark this file as linguistically validated.

### 🛠️ launch-production.bat
**Location:** `launch-production.bat`
**Language:** Windows Batch Script
**Status:** ✅ Valid scripting terms
**Notes:** Flagged terms like "Mashaaer" (project name) and "ERRORLEVEL" (Windows batch variable) are correct and valid.
**Validation:** A `LINGUISTIC_VALIDATED` tag has been added as a comment at the top of the file.

### 🛠️ build-and-serve.bat
**Location:** `build-and-serve.bat`
**Language:** Windows Batch Script
**Status:** ✅ Valid scripting terms
**Notes:** Flagged terms like "ERRORLEVEL" (Windows batch variable) are correct and valid.
**Validation:** A `LINGUISTIC_VALIDATED` tag has been added as a comment at the top of the file.

### 🎵 music_recommender.py
**Location:** `backend/music_recommender.py`
**Language:** Python with Arabic content
**Status:** ✅ Valid Arabic cultural content
**Notes:** All flagged Arabic words are valid Arabic transliterations or native artist names used in recommendation metadata, including:
**Validation:** A `LINGUISTIC_VALIDATED` tag has been added to the file's docstring.

- البوب, بيونسيه, شيران, إمينيم, توباك, لامار
- البيتلز, فلويد, زيبلين, رولينغ, ستونز
- لسيناد, أوكونور, رونسون, وبرونو

## Actions Taken

The following actions have been taken to address the linguistic validation issues:

1. **Created this report** documenting all verified files and their linguistic content.

2. **Added LINGUISTIC_VALIDATED tags** to the following files:
   - Added a tag in the docstring of `backend/music_recommender.py`
   - Added a comment tag at the top of `launch-production.bat`
   - Added a comment tag at the top of `build-and-serve.bat`
   - Created a companion `.validated` file for `src/translations/locales/fil.json` (since JSON doesn't support comments)

3. **Verified all flagged content** and confirmed that all flagged words are valid in their respective languages.

4. **Exported verified files** to a dedicated `i18n-verified/` folder:
   - Created a clean copy of all linguistically validated files
   - Maintained the original directory structure
   - Added a README.md explaining the purpose and contents of the folder
   - Created scripts to lock/unlock files from future overwrites:
     - `lock-files.ps1` / `lock-files.bat` - Sets files to read-only
     - `unlock-files.ps1` / `unlock-files.bat` - Removes read-only attribute

## Translation Platform Integration

The verified files in the `i18n-verified/` folder are ready for integration with translation platforms like Crowdin or Lokalise. Here's how to proceed:

1. **Crowdin Integration**:
   - Create a new Crowdin project for Mashaaer Enhanced
   - Use the files in `i18n-verified/` as source files
   - Configure Crowdin to preserve formatting and special characters
   - Set up target languages based on project requirements

2. **Lokalise Integration**:
   - Import the files from `i18n-verified/` into a new Lokalise project
   - Configure key detection and segmentation settings
   - Enable glossary features to maintain consistent translations of technical terms
   - Set up webhooks for automated synchronization if needed

3. **General Translation Guidelines**:
   - Maintain special formatting in translated content
   - Preserve technical terms and project-specific names (e.g., "Mashaaer")
   - Ensure proper handling of RTL languages like Arabic
   - Test translations in the application UI to verify layout and functionality

## Recommendations for Future QA

1. **Whitelist these files** in any automated spell-checking or linguistic validation tools to prevent false positives.

2. **Add language-specific dictionaries** to your spell-checking tools for:
   - Filipino language
   - Arabic transliterations of Western names
   - Technical terms used in batch scripts

3. **Document language expectations** for any new files that may contain non-English content to facilitate future validation.

4. **Implement a validation workflow** for new translations:
   - Linguistic validation by native speakers
   - Technical validation to ensure proper formatting
   - UI testing to verify display in the application
