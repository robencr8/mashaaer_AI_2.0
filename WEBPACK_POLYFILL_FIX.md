# Webpack 5 Polyfill Fix for Mashaaer Enhanced Project

## Problem Description

The frontend was starting but stopping with an error:
```
Can't resolve 'process/browser' in axios/lib/utils.js
```

This error occurs because Webpack 5 no longer includes automatic polyfills for Node.js libraries like:
- process
- buffer
- stream

The axios library depends on `process.env`, but in Webpack 5, `process/browser` is not provided automatically.

## Solution Implemented

The solution was to update the `config-overrides.js` file with proper Webpack 5 polyfill configuration:

1. Added `resolve.fallback` configuration which is the recommended approach for Webpack 5
2. Kept the `resolve.alias` configuration for backward compatibility
3. Added a `webpack.DefinePlugin` to explicitly define `process.env` for axios

### Key Changes in config-overrides.js:

```javascript
// Add resolve.fallback for Webpack 5
config.resolve.fallback = {
  ...config.resolve.fallback,
  path: require.resolve('path-browserify'),
  os: require.resolve('os-browserify/browser'),
  util: require.resolve('util/'),
  fs: require.resolve('browserify-fs'),
  buffer: require.resolve('buffer/'),
  process: require.resolve('process/browser'),
  stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
  assert: require.resolve('assert/'),
  events: require.resolve('events/'),
};

// Define process.env for axios
new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  'process.env': JSON.stringify(process.env)
})
```

## Testing

A test script (`test-frontend.bat`) was created to verify the fix:
1. Sets the NODE_OPTIONS environment variable to --openssl-legacy-provider
2. Starts the frontend using npm start

## Documentation Updates

The Arabic quick start guide (`QUICK_START_ARABIC.md`) was updated to include information about this issue and its solution in the troubleshooting section.
