# Linguistic Export Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the actions taken to export linguistically validated files to a dedicated folder, prepare them for translation platform integration, and protect them from accidental modifications.

## Requirements Implemented

Based on the requested options, the following features have been implemented:

1. **✅ Export verified files to i18n-verified/ folder**
   - Created a dedicated folder structure that mirrors the original project
   - Copied all linguistically validated files while preserving their paths
   - Added comprehensive documentation

2. **✅ Preparation for translation platform integration**
   - Added detailed instructions for Crowdin integration
   - Added detailed instructions for Lokalise integration
   - Provided general translation guidelines

3. **✅ Lock files from future overwrites**
   - Created PowerShell scripts to set/remove read-only attributes
   - Added batch file wrappers for easy execution on Windows
   - All exported files are now protected from accidental modifications

## Files Created

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - `i18n-verified/` - Root directory for verified files
   - `i18n-verified/src/translations/locales/` - For language files
   - `i18n-verified/backend/` - For backend files with Arabic content

2. **Documentation**:
   - `i18n-verified/README.md` - Explains the purpose and contents of the folder
   - Updated `LINGUISTIC_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` with new sections

3. **Utility Scripts**:
   - `i18n-verified/lock-files.ps1` - PowerShell script to set files as read-only
   - `i18n-verified/unlock-files.ps1` - PowerShell script to remove read-only attribute
   - `i18n-verified/lock-files.bat` - Batch wrapper for lock-files.ps1
   - `i18n-verified/unlock-files.bat` - Batch wrapper for unlock-files.ps1

## Exported Files

The following linguistically validated files have been exported:

1. **Filipino Language Files**:
   - `i18n-verified/src/translations/locales/fil.json`
   - `i18n-verified/src/translations/locales/fil.json.validated`

2. **Batch Script Files**:
   - `i18n-verified/launch-production.bat`
   - `i18n-verified/build-and-serve.bat`

3. **Python Files with Arabic Content**:
   - `i18n-verified/backend/music_recommender.py`

## Next Steps

1. **Translation Platform Setup**:
   - Create projects in Crowdin or Lokalise
   - Import the verified files as source files
   - Configure language settings and translation workflows

2. **Ongoing Maintenance**:
   - Use the unlock-files.bat script when modifications are needed
   - Re-lock files after modifications using lock-files.bat
   - Update the i18n-verified/ folder when new files are validated

## Conclusion

All requested features have been successfully implemented. The linguistically validated files are now:
- Exported to a dedicated folder
- Ready for integration with translation platforms
- Protected from accidental modifications
