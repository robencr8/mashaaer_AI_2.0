# Security Information for Mashaaer Enhanced Project

## üîê Security Status (April 2025)
- No critical vulnerabilities in production dependencies
- All remaining 8 vulnerabilities are in development-only packages
- Development remains safe to use with no exposure to end-users
- The `browserify-fs` package has been removed and replaced with `memfs`

## Security Recommendations

### For Development
- The current versions in package-lock.json have been frozen to maintain project stability
- Monitor `npm audit` monthly or before each major update to make informed decisions about package updates

### For Production Deployment
When deploying to production, remove development dependencies to eliminate all known vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Build the project for production
npm run build

# Remove development dependencies before deployment
npm prune --production
```

This ensures that the production deployment contains only the necessary dependencies and eliminates all development-only vulnerabilities.
