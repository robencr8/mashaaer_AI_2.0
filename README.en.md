## System Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have installed the following requirements:
- Node.js

## Running Steps

### 1. Running the Application at Full Capacity

```

This command will:

- System metrics at: http://localhost:5000/api/metrics

#### Successful Operation

If the message `Mashaaer Enhanced Project has been successfully bootstrapped!` appears, this means the operation was successful.

#### Error Handling

In case errors appear during operation:

‚ùó If the message `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` appears
Make sure the backend server is running on localhost:5000 using the command:

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

‚ùó If error messages related to basic requirements appear
Make sure all requirements mentioned in the "System Requirements" section are installed.
